				<h1>A Darker Outlook</h1>
				<p>You have chosen to side with the dark for your traditional mood, thoughts, and activities. Darkness is not constrained to good and evil, it is just a different way of looking at the world.
					Often this means siding with more relaxing activities with more mellow thoughts. You may enjoy quiet over the hustle and bustle of daily life, or you may enjoy solitude over being in a crowded room.
					This is what it looks like to side with the dark. </p> <br />

				<h1>A Brighter Outlook</h1>
				<p>You have chosen to side with the light for your mood, thoughts, and activities. Light is not constrained to being good and evil, it is just a different way of looking at, and reacting to the world.
					Often this means choosing more active activities while having a more outgoing, positive attitude. The more enjoyment that can fit into a day, the better. Going biking, hanging out with friends, or meeting new people
					are all enjoyable activities when choosing the light.

				<h1>Choose Your Side</h1>
				<p>When choosing sides  between dark and light, do not think of them as good and evil, but as a different way of preferring to live life.
					Think of how the there are differences between light and dark. What types of moods, activities, social situations, and energy levels
					exist between the two? What can you do on the beach at night compared to the beach during the day? What is your preference, etc </p>
				<p> After choosing a side, you will see a few more basic examples on the context of light and dark
					and you will be able to take a survey to compare your thoughts to other's thoughts in our brief survey. </p>
